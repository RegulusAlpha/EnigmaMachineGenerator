# EnigmaMachineGenerator
Randomly generate settings for the enigma machine

Here's a breakdown of what the program does:

    A loop runs for each day (represented by the variable day), where settings for that day are printed to the console.

    The program defines lists for rotor positions, rotor types, and rotor ring positions. These lists are randomly selected to configure the Enigma machine for each day.

    The program then selects and prints initial rotor positions, rotor types, and rotor ring positions.

    A reflector position is randomly selected and printed.

    The program shuffles the letters randomly for the plugboard, pairing them consecutively. The paired letters are then printed to the console.

    The loop repeats for each day (365 days in this case), generating and printing different settings for each day.

Overall, the program simulates the generation of Enigma machine settings for each day, with random rotor positions, types, ring positions, reflector positions, and plugboard pairings.
